# DumbTF
---
A deep learning library for dumb people. 

## Focus
---
- Implement convolution layers

## Installation
`pip install Dumb-TF`

Doesn't work though. Have patience. Was just learning to make packages.

## Status 
---
* Works well for regression.
* Implemented binary cross entropy - not satisfactory
* CCE Works, but too slow 
* It's so good to see the loss going down for boston housing regression. :)
* Keras vs DumbTF on boston housing. (Orange is keras)
