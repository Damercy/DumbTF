# DumbTF
---
A deep learning library for dumb people. 

## Focus
---
- Current focus is to create a dense network, to train MNIST.
- I was wrong. It's better to work on a regression problem first, because
  of the simple loss function.

## Installation
`pip install Dumb-TF`

Doesn't work though. Have patience. Was just learning to make packages.

## Status 
---
* It's so good to see the loss going down for boston housing regression. :)
